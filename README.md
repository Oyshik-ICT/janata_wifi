# CRUD Operation

This challenge is provided by [Janata Wifi ](https://janatawifi.com/)


CRUD operations are essential in software development. I am new to Django and had no knowledge of React JS. So, in two days, I studied React JS to understand its key concepts and how it works. Using this knowledge, I created a CRUD application. The data was provided by Janata WiFi. A few days ago, I wanted to work on a project, and Janata WiFi suddenly gave me this challenge. I have learned a lot from this experience.Gaining more knowledge about Django and React JS, I want to build this project to be more user-friendly and efficient.
